# Quantum Machine Learning on Bankruptcy Prediction

This project explores the application of both classical and quantum machine learning techniques for predicting bankruptcy based on financial datasets. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature selection, classical machine learning models, and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC).

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Financial indicators for bankruptcy prediction.
- **Objective:** Compare the performance of classical machine learning models and quantum machine learning using Qiskit.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Classical Models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - Quantum Models: Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) with feature maps and ansatz circuits.

## Features

- Feature engineering and selection using correlation thresholds.
- Class balancing using undersampling and SMOTE.
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.
- Quantum circuits for feature mapping and ansatz construction.
- Visualization of optimization progress during training.
